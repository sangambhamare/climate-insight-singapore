# AI/BI Hackathon Challenge Requirements Analysis

## Challenge Theme
The hackathon focuses on AI/BI solutions that leverage cutting-edge tools to solve complex Data and AI problems with social impact.

## Challenge Statement
Participants must leverage open data to create an AI/BI solution that tackles a social impact issue such as:
- Climate change resilience
- Public health insights
- Economic inequality analysis
- Energy consumption optimization

## Example Use Case
Analyzing the accessibility of public healthcare facilities for the elderly by combining datasets on healthcare locations and demographics using Singapore's open data portal (https://data.gov.sg/). This project could highlight underserved areas, guiding policy decisions to improve access and quality of care for Singapore's aging population.

## Required Technologies
The project must incorporate Databricks technologies to build an AI/BI use case, including:
- AI/BI dashboards
- Genie Spaces
- Databricks Apps
- Platform integrations with unified governance and enterprise-grade security
