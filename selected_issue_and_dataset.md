## Social Impact Issue: Climate Change Resilience for Singapore

### Issue Overview
Climate change poses significant challenges for Singapore as an island nation, including:
- Rising sea levels threatening coastal infrastructure
- Changing precipitation patterns affecting water security
- Increasing temperatures impacting public health and energy consumption
- Extreme weather events disrupting economic activities and infrastructure

As a densely populated urban island with limited natural resources, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Building resilience through data-driven approaches is critical for sustainable development and protecting the well-being of its population.

### Relevance to Hackathon Challenge
This issue aligns perfectly with the hackathon challenge statement, which specifically mentions "climate change resilience" as a potential social impact area. Our AI/BI solution will leverage open data to provide insights that can help policymakers, businesses, and communities make informed decisions to enhance Singapore's resilience to climate change impacts.

## Selected Dataset

### Primary Dataset
**Name**: Climate Change Indicators for Singapore  
**Source**: World Bank via Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)  
**URL**: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/world-bank-climate-change-indicators-for-singapore  
**Format**: CSV (97.3KB)  
**Time Period**: January 01, 1960 - December 31, 2024  
**Update Frequency**: Monthly  

### Dataset Description
This dataset contains comprehensive climate change indicators for Singapore collected by the World Bank. It includes various metrics related to:
- Access to electricity
- Agricultural productivity
- Population demographics
- Economic indicators
- Environmental metrics

The dataset is regularly updated and provides a long-term historical perspective (from 1960) that allows for trend analysis and future projections.

### Supplementary Data Sources
We will also leverage the World Bank's DataBank API for additional indicators as needed:
- Specific climate indicators (via DataBank/indicator_data API)
- Additional development indicators to provide context

### Data Exploration Plan
1. Download and analyze the primary dataset to identify key climate change indicators
2. Use the DataBank API to supplement with additional relevant indicators
3. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns
4. Identify correlations between climate indicators and socioeconomic factors
5. Prepare visualizations to communicate key insights

## Preliminary Indicators of Interest
Based on the dataset description, we plan to focus on the following key indicators:
- Temperature and precipitation patterns over time
- Sea level rise measurements
- Energy consumption and renewable energy adoption
- Agricultural productivity changes
- Economic impacts of climate events
- Population vulnerability metrics

## Potential Insights and Impact
Our AI/BI solution aims to generate the following types of insights:
1. Historical climate trend analysis for Singapore
2. Vulnerability assessment of different sectors and communities
3. Correlation between climate indicators and economic/social outcomes
4. Predictive models for future climate scenarios
5. Recommendations for targeted resilience-building interventions

These insights can inform policy decisions, urban planning, infrastructure development, and community preparedness initiatives to enhance Singapore's overall climate resilience.
